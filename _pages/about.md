I am currently a ESRC funded [Data Analytics and Society](https://datacdt.org/) Ph.D. student in the [Alliance Manchester Business School](https://www.alliancembs.manchester.ac.uk/) at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), Manchester, UK. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yu-wang Chen](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/yu-wang.chen.html) and [Associate Prof. Tahir Abbas Syed](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/tahirabbas.syed.html). My research interests are broadly in the intersection of network science, decision analytics, data analytics, Parrondo's paradox, and nonlinear dynamics.
